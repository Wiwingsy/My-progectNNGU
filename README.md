The task of the final work is to apply the skills acquired during training in working with web technologies to develop a website based on a ready-made layout from the Figma application. The layout was chosen taking into account modern requirements for web design, the possibility of using new technologies in website development. I wanted to use technologies such as sliders, flex, grid, unfolding lists, feedback form development, video file placement. My choice was stopped on the layout for the non-existing European University of Design and Arts "European University of Arts"
